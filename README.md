# Week 8

This week's lab is meant to introduce you to Natural Language Processing (NLP), and provide a very brief survey of some methods used in the field. In particular, we'll cover the following:

- Preprocessing
- Vectorization
- Topic Modeling
- Visualization

*Note: in this course, will not cover the aspects of NLP which use artificial neural networks.*
